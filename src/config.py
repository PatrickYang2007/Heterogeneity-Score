"""Shared experiment configuration.

Edit WINDOW (and AGGREGATE) here ONCE; the data-prep scripts (widen_windows.py,
aggregate_bins.py) and train.py all import these, so the window size stays in sync
across the whole pipeline instead of being set in three separate files.

Workflow when you change WINDOW:
  1. Set WINDOW (and AGGREGATE) below.
  2. Regenerate the matching data for that size (run once):
       AGGREGATE = False -> widen_windows.py   -> data/{split}_w{WINDOW}.parquet
       AGGREGATE = True  -> aggregate_bins.py   -> data/{split}_agg{WINDOW}.parquet
  3. Train: train.py picks the right files and checkpoint automatically.
